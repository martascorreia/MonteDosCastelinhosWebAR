# MonteDosCastelinhosWebAR

This project was created in the scope of my Master's thesis in Informatic Engineering, titled "Web Augmented Reality applied to Cultural Heritage". 

Files:

  -> app folder - app code

  -> Poster LASIGE.pdf - poster created for "LASIGE Workshop 2024"

  -> Presentation.pdf - presentation for my dissertation's defense

You can find my thesis at: https://repositorio.ulisboa.pt/handle/10400.5/95457

The website is in European Portuguese and it is advised to be open on a mobile device since the interface was not fully designed for desktops.
To access the website go to: https://martascorreia.github.io/MonteDosCastelinhosWebAR/. Note that the AR experiences will still be usable, but the alignment with the ruins can only be done on site.

To run the app locally:
- open a terminal in the app folder;
- npm install
- npm start.
